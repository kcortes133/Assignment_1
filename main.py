# Purpose: Take a tab delimited .gmz file of gene sets, a given tab-delimited STRING file
#   create a sub network of the gene interactions from the input file using the STRING file
#   output a SIR tab-delimited file for input to cytoscape

import operator
from functools import reduce


# assumptions:
#   input is tab delimited
#   first two indices in line should be thrown away
#   gene in 'locus for gene' will be repeated in the list
#   locus number is unimportant for network
#   gene interactions should be examined across and within all gene sets
#
# limitations:
#   gene interactions only shown if in STRING network
#   only known gene interactions and given genes
#
#   Returns a list of genes.
#   Expects a .txt tab-delimited file as input.
#   First two columns in file rows are discarded
#
#   @param fileIn file with genes to be read in
#   @return genes list of genes to check interactions for
def readInput(fileIn):
    # read in GMT file
    # separate file into list by tabs
    fI = open(fileIn, 'r')
    genes = fI.read().strip().split('\n')
    genes = [g.split('\t') for g in genes]

    # Delete first two columns
    for g in genes:
        if len(g) > 1:
            del g[0]
            del g[0]

    # condense list of lists into one-dimensional list
    genes = reduce(operator.add, genes)

    return genes


# assumptions:
#   input is organized as protein'\t'protein'\t'weight'\n'
#   protein1:protein2:weight is also represented in the list as protein2:protein1:weight
#
#   limitations:
#   dictionary would not work if the protein:protein interaction was only represented once
#
#   Returns dictionary of protein interactions ordered protein:protein:weight
#   Expects tab-delimited STRING file as input
#
#   @param   stringFile STRING file of protein-protein interactions
#            organized as protein'\t'protein'\t'weight'\n'
#   @returns interactions dict of protein interactions

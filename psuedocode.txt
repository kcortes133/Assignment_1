Output:

def readInput(fileIn):
    read in input file delimited by '\t' and '\n' and get rid of first two columns
    read fileIn
    strip new line characters
    turn fileIn into a list by separating at tabs
    delete first two column in each row
    make gene list one dimensional
    return gene list


def makeInteractionNetwork(stringFile):
    read STRING file turn into dictionary where gene1{gene2: weight2, gene3:weight3....}
    read in string file
    organize string file into a list of lists split by '\n' and '\t'
    turn list of lists into a dictionary where list[-1]{list[1]: list[2]}


def makeNetwork(genes, interactionsNetwork):
    iterate through gene list check if in string network
    remove genes if a hit
    continue

def makeNetworkSIF(geneInteractions,outFile):
    so now have some list/dict of gene:gene:weight
    turn into cytoscape readable file

read STRING file turn into dictionary where gene1{gene2: weight2, gene3:weight3....}

read in string file
organize string file into a list of lists split by '\n' and '\t'
turn list of lists into a dictionary where list[-1]{list[1]: list[2]}

read in input file delimited by '\t' and '\n' and get rid of first two columns

iterate through gene list check if in string network
remove genes if a hit
continue

so now have some list/dict of gene:gene:weight
turn into cytoscape readable file
